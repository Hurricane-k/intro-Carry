# can't insert image using Addins 'insert image'
written in 02/04/2023<br>
I find some out-of-date post about failure to insert images using blogdown, but all of them are released two or five years ago.<br>
Now Mine is the latest version of blogdown, but something strange is still there. :anguished:<br>

<br>
![left:.Rmd Right:rendered .html](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56281608/216757618-2a218d19-5d03-4a03-9e75-b6458ae6777b.png)<br>
<br>

There is <font color='red'>a broken icon</font> in place of the inserted image on the rendered page.<br>
By the way, **every time I refresh the rendered page, it will trigger IDM to download the image I inserted just now**. That's really confusing.
