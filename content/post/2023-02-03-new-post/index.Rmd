# this is new page I post
test<br> 
insert a picture<br>
![this is a test image](images/LenaRGB.tif)<br>

details about my problem
I inserted a image following the [tutorial]('https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/rstudio-ide.html'), but there is not image shown, there is only a broken icon reminding me the failure.<br>
I browse around and search the solution, all of them is out of date. I have to ask Stackoverflow for help. Hope someone can help me what's going on as soon as possible.<br>
I saw Yihui, one of authors of blogdown, answered a relevant post in 2020. He said maybe the `.Rmd` file was unable to show image well. But the new post I created is `.Rmd` file, which makes me confused.
